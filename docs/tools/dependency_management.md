<small>Poetry is a Python dependency management and packaging tool. It simplifies the process of managing project dependencies, creating virtual environments, and packaging Python projects for distribution. Poetry uses a pyproject.toml file to define dependencies and project settings, making it a modern and user-friendly tool for Python developers.</small>
