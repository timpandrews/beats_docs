<small>Pre-commit is a Python tool that helps developers ensure code quality and consistency by automatically running a set of pre-defined code checks and formatting tasks before each commit to a version control system (such as Git). It allows you to define a list of hooks or checks in a configuration file, and these checks can include linting, code formatting, spell-checking, and more. Pre-commit helps catch issues early in the development process, ensuring that only well-formatted and clean code gets committed to a project's repository, thereby maintaining code quality and consistency across the team.</small>
